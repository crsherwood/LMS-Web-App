# LMS Web App Project

This project is an LMS or Learning Management System like Canvas. The application allows a user to sign up as a student or teacher. Teachers are able to create courses, sections, and assignments as well as grade the assignments. Students can register for classes, view and complete assignments, and pay for tuition. I worked on this project as part of a team of four members.
